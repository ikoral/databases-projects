## Build you own ER diagram:

Imagine the database of a travel agency. It offers trips around the world and now it is in the process of creating an online system for reservations. Each customer can make reservation for a trip, which will have a start date and an end date. What will be the possible entities and what will be their fields? Draw an ER diagram with at least 5 entities to explain.
You can use [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) or the software of you choice. The final form should be submitted in pdf. Be careful to use the correct relationships between the entities. Keep it simple :)

## Create your database:

Create a database for the library based on the EDR diagram that we made today. Create the tables and populate them. You can choose to how extended your database will be but create at least 4 tables with 3 or 4 rows in each. Make sure that you use the correct data types (and that you use at least 3 different ones, eg: text, number, date). Keep in mind, a Library can have more than one copies of a book. There should be a mechanism to know if a copy is available or not. (HINT: Use the sample databases you downloaded to help you)
Optional: Try to think what would be a good identifier (primary key) in each of your tables.

## Write queries to retrieve data that answers the following questions:

### Use world.sql db.

- What are the names of the countries with population greater than 8 million
- What are the names of the countries that have “land” in their names ?
- What are the names of the cities with population in between 500,000 and 1 million ?
- What are the names of all the countries on the continent ‘Europe’ ?
- List all the countries in the descending order based on their surface areas.

### If you have time left and want more practice you can try these optional homework exercises:

Write queries that answer the following questions:

- What are the names of all the cities in the Netherlands?
- What's the population of Rotterdam?
- What's the top 10 countries based on surface area?
- What's the top 10 cities with the highest population?
- What's the population of the world ?
